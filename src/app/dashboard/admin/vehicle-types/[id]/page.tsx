// This file is intentionally left blank to resolve a Next.js routing conflict.
// It is not a page and should not be treated as one.
// By not exporting a default React component, Next.js should ignore this as a page route,
// which resolves the "different slug names for the same dynamic path" build error.
// The conflicting route is `[vehicleTypeId]`.
